## Question 1.a

### Data Preprocessing
We would like to preprocess the data into a graph to better understand it. By picturing the data as a graph we will be able to take the largest connectivity component and answer question 1a accordingly.
The following is the code we used to create the graph seen below it.


As seen in the graph, we extracted the largest component in the graph. Let's calculate the scores for each measure requested.

#### Betweeness

#### Closeness

#### Eigenvector
